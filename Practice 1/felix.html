<h1>AGRICULTURE IN KENYA</h1>

<div>Agriculture in Kenya dominates Kenya's economy. 15–17 percent of Kenya's total land area has sufficient fertility and rainfall to be farmed,
  and 7–8 percent can be classified as first-class land.[1][2] In 2006, almost 75 percent of working Kenyans made their living by farming,
  compared with 80 percent in 1980.[1] About one-half of Kenya's total agricultural output is non-marketed subsistence production.
</div>
<div>
  Agriculture is also the largest contributor to Kenya’s gross domestic product (GDP).
  [1] In 2005, agriculture, including forestry and fishing, accounted for about 24 percent of the GDP,
  as well as 18 percent of wage employment and 50 percent of revenue from exports.[1]

<div>
  Farming is the most important economic sector in Kenya, although less than 8 percent of the land is used for crop and feed production,
  and less than 20 percent is suitable for cultivation. Kenya is a leading producer of tea and coffee, as well as the third-leading exporter of fresh produce,
  such as cabbages, onions and mangoes. Small farms grow most of the corn and also produce potatoes, bananas, beans, peas and chillies.
